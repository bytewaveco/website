# scroll-interactions

The scroll interaction system implements two primary business components:

## Water Parallax Effect (src/components/Water.vue)
- Dynamic parallax effect tied to page scroll position
- Custom scroll position calculations drive water visual movement
- Opacity transitions based on viewport scroll depth
- Call-to-action element movement synchronized with scroll position
Importance Score: 60/100

## Project Showcase Scroll System (src/components/Projects.vue)
- Position-based animation triggered by scroll events
- Z-index management for 3D depth effect while scrolling
- Offset calculation system for project element positioning
- 4000ms timed rotation sequence integrated with scroll position
Importance Score: 75/100

Key Relationships:
- Water parallax effect serves as primary visual engagement tool
- Project showcase animations provide content reveal mechanics
- Both systems work in concert to create unified scroll experience

Integration Points:
- Scroll position data flows from root viewport
- Animation triggers based on element visibility
- Cross-component position synchronization
