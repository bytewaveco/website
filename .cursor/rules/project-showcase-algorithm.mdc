# project-showcase-algorithm

The portfolio showcase implements a specialized carousel animation system with the following key components:

## Timing Control
- 4000ms interval-based rotation cycle
- Automated transitions between portfolio projects
- Located in: src/components/Projects.vue

## Z-Index Management
- Custom layering system for 3D-like depth effect
- Dynamic z-index calculations based on current position
- Creates visual hierarchy for active/inactive projects

## Position Calculation
Project positioning uses custom offset calculations:
- Determines x/y coordinates for each project card
- Manages visual stacking order
- Handles transitions between positions

## Integration Points
The showcase algorithm coordinates:
- Project card transitions
- Timing synchronization
- Layer management
- Position updates

Importance Score: 75/100
(Scored based on unique presentation logic and custom animation implementation)
